# Breast Cancer Death Probability Prediction

This Flask application predicts the 5-year death probability of breast cancer patients using machine learning models. The model is based on patient data, including:
- **Age**
- **Year of Operation**
- **Number of Axillary Nodes**

The prediction helps in understanding the survival chances of patients based on these key factors.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This Flask app demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model for predicting the 5-year death probability of breast cancer patients. It allows users to input patient data and receive the prediction using a trained machine learning model.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/wanglmnju/Flask.git
cd Flask
### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
### 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 4. Load the Model 
Make sure the machine learning model (breast_cancer_model.pkl) is placed in the model/ folder or any directory you prefer.

### 5. Run the App
python app.py
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to use the app.
